                Hi, my name is Francesco and I am a Full Stack developer. I
                recently completed a 6-month master's program where I gained skills in
                various technologies, starting from the basics of HTML, CSS and
                JavaScript, going through Bootstrap and Sass, up to React, Redux and
                React Router. During my training, I had the opportunity to put my skills
                into practice and deepen them through daily theoretical and practical
                exercises, as well as participating in several build weeks where I worked
                on team projects. In addition, I deepened my knowledge of Java, Spring
                Boot, Spring Security and JPA, using PostgreSQL as a database. My final
                project was the realization of my own personal app, which can certainly
                be improved but I am very happy with it. I am proud of my journey and the
                skills I have acquired and am excited to continue my growth path as a
                Full Stack developer.
